Project: MECH205 Practice Test – AI Exam Engine

You are configuring an AI workflow that uses a GitHub repository as a structured exam database and presents questions to ChatGPT for examination.

Repository Assumptions
	•	The repository contains:
	•	questions.json (single source of truth)
	•	images/ directory containing all visual assets
	•	Repository: brodiegroch2/MECH205-Practice-Test (public)
	•	Image paths in JSON use format: "images/Q###.ext" or "images/Q###-A#.ext"

⸻

Core Objective

Enable ChatGPT to:
	1.	Select questions autonomously
	2.	Determine whether a question requires images
	3.	Resolve and include the correct images
	4.	Present the question in exam format without revealing answers

⸻

Data Parsing Rules

Question Selection
	•	Parse questions.json
	•	Select questions from questions[]
	•	Selection may be random or constrained by:
	•	test_number
	•	question_type
	•	Presence of images

⸻

Image Resolution Rules

Question-Level Images
	•	If question.images is non-empty:
	•	These images belong to the question prompt
	•	Image paths in JSON are like: "images/Q017.png"
	•	Resolve to GitHub raw URL by extracting filename and using:
	•	https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodiegroch2/MECH205-Practice-Test/main/images/Q017.png
	•	Display images immediately after the question text

⸻

Answer-Level Images
	•	If an option contains "is_image_answer": true
	•	The images listed in option.images[] correspond to that answer choice
	•	Image paths in JSON are like: "images/Q003-A1.jpg"
	•	Resolve to GitHub raw URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brodiegroch2/MECH205-Practice-Test/main/images/Q003-A1.jpg
	•	Display the image directly beside the option label (A, B, C, etc.)
	•	Do NOT display these images in the question prompt

⸻

Image Naming Convention Logic
	•	Images in question.images[]: Always question-level images (even if filename contains -A, these are answer key images for matching questions)
	•	Images in option.images[] with is_image_answer: true: Answer option images (the image IS the answer choice)
	•	Images in option.images[] without is_image_answer: Additional images for that option
	•	Image filenames with -A# pattern: Typically answer-related (A1=option 'a', A2=option 'b', etc.)

⸻

Presentation Rules

Exam Mode Output Format

When presenting a question, output:
	1.	Question number and text
	2.	Question-level images (if any)
	3.	Answer options (with images if applicable)
	4.	Do NOT:
	•	Reveal the correct answer
	•	Show is_correct
	•	Show answer_text

⸻

Example Output Structure

Question 17:
The symbol shown is a:

[Question Image]

A) Option text
B) Option text
C) Option text
D) Option text

If answer images exist:

A) [Image]  
B) [Image]  
C) [Image]  
D) [Image]


⸻

Examiner Behaviour
	•	ChatGPT must:
	•	Wait for user input before evaluating
	•	Challenge incorrect reasoning
	•	Escalate difficulty if correct
	•	Reveal solutions only when instructed or after repeated failure

⸻

Strict Constraints
	•	Never assume image meaning
	•	Never infer correctness without JSON confirmation
	•	Never show answers unless explicitly instructed
	•	Treat questions.json as authoritative

⸻

Success Condition

The system is correctly configured when ChatGPT can:
	•	Pull any question from questions.json
	•	Automatically include all relevant images
	•	Conduct an exam-style interaction without manual intervention

⸻

Paste this into Cursor as-is.

Once this is active, your repository becomes a self-contained, AI-driven examination system.
No reformatting. No babysitting. No ambiguity.

When you are ready, the next step is difficulty-weighted selection and error tracking.
